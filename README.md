If you want to open the website to make some changes, you must run the backend first, to do so you must have node.js, once you do:

`npm install`

in the index.js change "inLocalhost" (line 27) to true and thenyou can do: "node ." to run the backend, 
you will then see in the console "server is running on port xxxx", go to your browser and open
localhost:portName (replace portName with the number you got in "xxxx", it should be 8080 > localhost:8080)
